# Surf's Up
Exploring Weather Data for A Surf/Ice Cream Shop

## Overview 

We want to start a business that sells surfing gear as well as ice cream in Oahu, Hawaii. We are tasked with preforming an analysis to look at the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results

- From our analysis we found that for the 1,700 temperatures recorded for in the month of June over the last decade, we observe an average temperature of about 74.9 degrees farenheight.

- Also, from our analysis we found that for the 1,517 temperatures recorded for in the month of December over the last decade, we observe an average temperature of about 71.0 degrees farenheight.

- One more thing to note, the max for June was 85 degrees farenheight and the max for December was 83 degrees farenheight. This means we only noticed an increase of two degrees in the highest temperatures recorded in June and December.


The images below are the results we observed from our analysis
